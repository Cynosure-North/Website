<p>I’m currently rehearsing for Crossbow Cat, to be performed soon. I’m playing Cinnamon, who happens to be a cat.
Cinnamon gained the ability to walk and talk when Martha shot her in the head with a crossbow, and now she’s back for revenge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s been fascinating playing a cat, I was inspired by The Cat from Coraline and Cheshire Cat, but with more resentment.
Cats are extremely mobile, and it turns out I love to move this way. The challenge of making myself look that mobile is interesting, there’s lots of lounging in odd positions, and pouncing on furniture. It’s as if a child was coordinated.
Emotionally, Cinnamon needs therapy. She’s a mess. There’s a whole lot of anger at Martha for shooting her, resulting in her ostracisation from cat society, but below that there’s intense fear and loneliness. Cinnamon refuses to confront this though. She stalks and plans to kill Martha, but when goes to do it she’s so wildly off base. She brings knives, and doesn’t even throw a punch. She is lost, and running from that towards an unquestioned goal. She’s not going to let that stop her though. Cinnamon has a plan.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We’ll be performing from the 4th of September until the 8th at Studio 77 2021.</p>
