I've encountered an issue builidng this site. There are some subtle differences in the rendering when rendering locally vs when rendering on github pages, and that it causing an error.
It's specifically in the code blocks, so Chroma may be at fault.
Local:
	The links for the line numbers generate as <a style="outline: none; text-decoration:none; color:inherit" href="#cows-9">  9</a>
GH-Pages:
	<a class="lnlinks" href="#cows-9">  9</a>

Notice that GH-Pages has no inline style and instead has the class lnlinks.
Also there is the issue of the spacing before the numbers, but one thing at a time
