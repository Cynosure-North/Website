Maybe compositing but what about the rest

1. Bulky + Heavy
2. Upgrades/repairs, if gaf
3. Corporate environments
	a. Buy prescription lenses for those who need it
		logistics
		cost
		lenses are built in and basically impossible to replace, and very specific so they're worthless when the employee leaves
		need to be precise or else headaches/nausea
	b. Goggles over glasses
		horrendous design challenge
	c. Use employees devices
		right to log off
		security
			bossware on personal devices probably illegal
			or redesign all apps to use computer as dumb control and run compute on company severs
				cost of redesign
				performance

Easier to have external puck which can be swapped
So glasses + gloves are just interface

More broadly, it's a question of whether they're devices or extensions of our senses/humanity letting us see into a different realm
