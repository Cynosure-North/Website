Bret Victor doesn't like because complexity of the system.
But it's about where you put it. More complexity of the AR device means less complexity elsewhere.
It enables anyone to create virtual stuff and place it in the world, and then hide as needed.
The idea that everything should always be visible isn't how the world works.

Ideally it would be microkernel + compositor, and then applications only get camera access as needed.
