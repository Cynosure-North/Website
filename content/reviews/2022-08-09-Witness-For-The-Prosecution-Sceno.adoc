The thing everyone talks about is the location. Staged in the London County Hall, it's a building filled with nearly 100 years of history as the centre of local government for London, and the architecture reflects this. The building is huge, and the central chamber have towering ceilings, with massive marble columns. This creates a feeling of weight and smallness, like being crushed beneath something far bigger than you. The lighting design enhances this. The ceiling is shrouded in darkness, and the columns are lit up part way, to seem as if they go on forever. The judge is on a raised seat, reminiscent of a throne, and lit with a low front light creating a halo like effect. They make extensive use of spotlights as well, especially on the witness box. This draws all the attention to that small area and makes the actors pop out All of this serves to make the action of the stage that much more important. It's the only part that's lit up, it's a gripping, human scale story.

One interesting consequence of the location is that there is no backstage. This means every entrance and exit is from the doors by the audience, including the stage crew changing the props. I found it a bit weird initially, but I came to really like it. It forces the set design to be stripped back to the bare essentials, which allows the actors to make much better use of the limited stage. It reminded me of servants carrying processions of furniture around for old royalty, which heightened the sense of importance. 
Having the characters walk down the aisles silently also made them seem more important, kind of like a wrestler strutting to the ring. It gave a moment to reflect on everything that had happened so far and anticipate where the case would go next. When this was broken, and characters then walked in mid conversation it created an immediacy to the scene which would be hard to replicate without the pattern.

The thrust stage is used excellently. The most significant is to weaken the defendant, Leonard Vole. This spot is lit up with harsh white lights, and is surrounded by the audience on 3 sides. This is a position of weakness and fear. Psychologically, it's uncomfortable to stand with your backs to large groups of people, which is why people generally sit around the edges of the room with their backs to the wall. This is not an option for Vole, he is trapped by the audience, and he is under their scrutiny, aided by the unflinching light. This is contrasted by the strength of the court. They are lit in warmer colours, raised up, and protected by the huge wooden desks. All of this creates an overpowering power imbalance., and as audiences we typically like to root for the underdog. The story is written in such a way to make Vole seem innocent, and the set is framed to enhance this. All of this effort leading to one conclusion makes the twist all the more shocking. It upends the audience's understanding of the entire plays on multiple levels, and adds a sociopathic twist to Vole. For him to be able to seem so weak and and yet be the one in control is unnerving.
