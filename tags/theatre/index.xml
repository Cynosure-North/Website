      <description>Perhaps I’m too youong to geth the humour, maybe it went way over my head and I’m going to look like a fool as soon as I publish this. I now understand the bravery it requires to get on stage with that as your set. I can see myself enjoying this around a dinner with friends and family, as everyone is a little drunk and full, and only half paying attention.</description>

      <description>I’m currently rehearsing for Crossbow Cat, to be performed soon. I’m playing Cinnamon, who happens to be a cat. Cinnamon gained the ability to walk and talk when Martha shot her in the head with a crossbow, and now she’s back for revenge.
 It’s been fascinating playing a cat, I was inspired by The Cat from Coraline and Cheshire Cat, but with more resentment. Cats are extremely mobile, and it turns out I love to move this way.</description>

      <description>Written by Lynda Chanwai-Earle Directed by Kerryn Palmer and Sally Richards Music Composed by Gareth Farr Starring Sepe Mua’au, Stevie Hancox-Monk, and Elle Wootton Viewed on 28/11/2021
 I wasn’t really sure what I was in for when I saw Hole. What I got was a rich exploration of the way personal relationships can spill into the wider world. The play follows Stella, an atmospheric scientist investigating the recent ozone hole.</description>

      <description>The line &amp;#39;A token effort has been made to include the abled as well’ appears in the marketing material, I believe this is what they intended. Alas, this like most of the show falls flat. The story follows Susan as they navigate their life dealing with bigotry in all forms. In doing so it asks able bodied audiences to not be cunts, to show that the minorities are in fact people who are working their hardest, and need to be empowered.</description>
