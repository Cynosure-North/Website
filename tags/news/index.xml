      <description>I’m currently rehearsing for Crossbow Cat, to be performed soon. I’m playing Cinnamon, who happens to be a cat. Cinnamon gained the ability to walk and talk when Martha shot her in the head with a crossbow, and now she’s back for revenge.
 It’s been fascinating playing a cat, I was inspired by The Cat from Coraline and Cheshire Cat, but with more resentment. Cats are extremely mobile, and it turns out I love to move this way.</description>
