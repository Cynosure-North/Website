## Directories
### Content
This is the folder where the text goes. I use asciidoc instead of markdown because of the extra flexibility.  
I currently have 2 sections, my blog and theatre reviews. There's also a landing page I rejected, but couldn't bring myself to delete  

### Layouts
Here are the templates, it's currently pretty basic, although I'll probably expand in future.

### Static
Stuff that is just copied over directly. Stuff probably won't always stay here (TODO: I have plans around images, but that'l come later)
