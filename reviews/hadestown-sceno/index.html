<p>I’m hardly original when I say that I loved Hadestown. I crave the feeling of being swept away, and Hadestown absolutely did it. Much has been made of the excellent songs, so I want to talk about the scenography (also that’s the assignment).</p>

<p>In the initial run the stage was a thrust stage, and this likely would have created and intimate feeling, with the audience on 3 sides, and much closer to eye level to the actors. In contrast the Broadway production is on a raised stage, and this makes the characters feel more important, and less relatable. This is good for the gods, but more work had to be done to bring Orpheus and Eurydice down to earth. With the move to London the set was redesigned, it moved from the under the shade of a tree to a worn out bar. I didn’t see the initial production, yet I can’t help but think of it as an improvement based on pictures. The tale is reimagined against a backdrop of american industry and a rising tide of fascism, and for me the tree conjures images of relaxing summers reading stories of faraway heros rather than modern tragedies. Although perhaps it did seem faraway before Trump and the pandemic. The new location is excellent, it gives the feel of a story told over drinks. This helps to ground Orpheus and Eurydice. In interviews the set designer talked of the audience realising the bar is in the bottom of an oil drum, stuck telling the same story forever. I think this was an excellent decision as it makes the story feel truthful and real at the start and hopeless by the end.</p>

<p>One of the most effective decisions is to have the space mirror The Hero’s Journey (as far as any folk story matches such a broad pattern). It starts out seeming cosy and comfortable, and as Orpheus leaves the known the word becomes more barren. The furniture is taken offstage, the background lighting darkens, and at act break, when Orpheus is at the lowest point the set splits.
All this serves to convey the lengths Orpheus is going to to get Eurydice back, and heightens the drama. What makes the story a tragedy is how close they get, and the lighting and the set make it so obvious they were just there. The tables and chairs are waiting metres away to become the bar, the lighting is spreading and chasing the shadows away, and then it all crumbles apart.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another element that was really cool was the turntable and elevator platform in the centre of the stage. Set designer Rachel Chavkin talked about how she chose to use a because they &#39;required a way to journey down to the underworld, and a way to journey back&#39; and &#39;circles are pretty old&#39;. Building on this, the circular turntable goes around the elevator in the centre so it feels like the long way down, like a set of stairs. Throughout the play the treadmill is used so people can move while staying in place, which is such a perfect metaphor for both the theme of retelling old tales, and the realities of modern life under late capitalism. Even if someone does somehow manage to work against society pushing them back they’re eventually forced back. Time is a flat circle, and nothing ever changes, unless we step off.</p>
