<p>The line &#39;A token effort has been made to include the abled as well’ appears in the marketing material, I believe this is what they intended. Alas, this like most of the show falls flat. The story follows Susan as they navigate their life dealing with bigotry in all forms. In doing so it asks able bodied audiences to not be cunts, to show that the minorities are in fact people who are working their hardest, and need to be empowered. It’s disappointing then the same care was not taken to the production of the show.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are three good scenes in the play, which are funny and heartfelt. The rest is a boring dirge with little to say.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The play starts out with a fleetingly humorous argument between Susan and the audio describer that is incredibly derivative of The Stanley Parable. The action then moves to the bus station where there was an excellent opportunity to demonstrate how society disables people. The bus is formed by turning a ladder up. A distinctly non literal, low quality visual could have been a fully immersive experience for the blind to reinforce how society disables people rather than them being inherently lesser. Instead we listen to an unfunny sentence or two then a long minute of scraping noises as Susan laboriously drags the ‘bus’ back to the centre of the stage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From there we get the first of the three good scenes. Susan has a humiliating, infuriating, and from reports, all too common argument with the doctor in order to get an actual diagnosis, rather than inane judgement. If only this scene had good dialogue, if only the doctor didn’t feel like a cartoon villain who gave up after the requisite 3 hoops had been jumped through. If only the pace was maintained.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After that we get the second of the three good scenes where again the production fails to support the message. Susan walks through the audience bantering with them, but while this happens the captions just say ‘(Susan talks to the audience)’. Shockingly real, hilarious moments are entirely inaccessible to anyone relying on the captions - the very thing the play sets out to criticise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The final good scene is Susan lying on their bed in the grips of Executive Dysfunction, I wish we had more this viceral. It brilliantly captured how disability can rob someone’s ability to live life in a thousand small ways, and how its impact is often invisible to those without disability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The ending was a trite and tedious metaphor of slaying the monster that felt out of place and wasn’t helped by the lackluster sound effects. A fitting cap.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the unique features was the captions. While standard in film and television it is rare in live theatre. It was an excellent idea that would enable more people to enjoy live theatre, but they failed to live up to expectations. They often lagged behind the performance making it harder to follow, at which point the operator would speed through the lines, ending up ahead of the performance and robbing jokes of the little remaining humour. The audio description was effective, if sparse.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the shining elements of the play is the sock puppets. They stand in for the other characters and this level of inherent mockery really helps sell the absurd horror of entitled idiots trying to butt in. The vocal performances are great, and while the puppetry and ventriloquism are lacking it actually helps the message (for once). I had that to keep me going while I impatiently waited for Susan to put on the damn socks. It happens around 8 times in the play, and in each case it’s a minute long affair with nothing else happening. A full minute to contemplate the poor characterisation and aimless plot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Overall there are some good ideas, and a couple of decent jokes, but it’s not enough to distract from the agonisingly slow pacing. If it had gone twice as fast I would like this. There are weak points, but at least I wouldn’t have had all that time to dwell on them.</p>
